This is my first repository that I tested on github. 

Using the bash commandline I was able to learn the fundimentals of git to a certain extent:

- Initilizing a project.
- Adding files to the staging area.
- Commiting to the local repository.
- Pushing to remote repositories.
- Creating local branches.
- Pushing the branches to GitHub
- Logging informaiton.
- Merging branches together, solving merge conflicts.

This is general overview of what I learned, I will continue to work on the fundimentals of using git and GitHub. 

I will be using git for a few projects that I have in mind in the future.
