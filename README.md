This is my first push to my GitHub profile.

I've switched to an experimental branch, which I will push to github.
This is for myself so I can learn how branches appear on my github profile.

Here is an example of more branching. 

For this test I will test some pull requests and merge this branch with the master, since the master is a few commits behind.
This will be a good test to get it up to speed and solve merge conflicts.
